# PRD_001: Logseq Markdown Converter

## Press Release

**HEADLINE:** Introducing Logseq Markdown Converter - Transform Your Knowledge Graph Into Standard Markdown

**SUBHEADLINE:** A simple, powerful tool that converts Logseq knowledge graphs into standard Markdown files while preserving structure and references.

**INTRO PARAGRAPH:** Today, we're excited to announce the Logseq Markdown Converter, a streamlined solution for knowledge workers who use Logseq but need to share or publish their notes in standard Markdown format. This tool bridges the gap between Logseq's specialized bullet-based format and the universal Markdown standard.

**PROBLEM STATEMENT:** Logseq users face challenges when trying to share their knowledge outside the Logseq ecosystem. The specialized bullet-point format doesn't translate well to other platforms, making collaboration difficult and limiting publishing options. Additionally, complex features like block references and namespaces don't have direct equivalents in standard Markdown.

**SOLUTION:** Logseq Markdown Converter transforms your Logseq knowledge graph into clean, structured standard Markdown while intelligently preserving links, references, and hierarchical organization. The converted files work seamlessly with any Markdown-compatible tool, making it easy to publish to blogs, wikis, or share with colleagues who don't use Logseq.

**CUSTOMER QUOTE:** "As a researcher who uses Logseq for my notes but needs to publish my findings widely, the Logseq Markdown Converter has been a game-changer. I can keep my preferred knowledge management system while easily sharing my work with colleagues and publishing it online. What used to take hours of manual reformatting now happens with a single command." - Alex Chen, Academic Researcher

**HOW TO GET STARTED:** Simply install the tool via npm, point it to your Logseq graph directory, specify an output location, and run the conversion. The tool handles the rest, creating a clean, organized set of standard Markdown files ready for use anywhere.

**CLOSING:** Logseq Markdown Converter removes the barriers between your personal knowledge system and the wider world, allowing you to use the best tool for personal knowledge management without sacrificing shareability and publishing options.

## FAQ

### Customer FAQ

1. **What is Logseq Markdown Converter?**
   A command-line tool that converts Logseq's specialized Markdown format into standard Markdown that works with any platform that supports Markdown.

2. **How does Logseq Markdown Converter make my life easier?**
   It eliminates the manual work of reformatting Logseq notes for publishing or sharing, preserving links, references, and hierarchical structure automatically.

3. **Is there a cost for this tool?**
   No, it's an open-source tool freely available for all Logseq users.

4. **Will I lose any information during conversion?**
   The converter preserves content, structure, and links. Some Logseq-specific features like queries may be simplified, but all content remains intact.

5. **Do I need programming knowledge to use this tool?**
   Basic command-line familiarity is helpful, but the tool has a simple interface and clear documentation designed for all users.

### Technical FAQ

1. **What technologies does this feature use?**
   It's built with Node.js for cross-platform compatibility, using file system operations and text processing to transform Logseq format to standard Markdown.

2. **Are there any performance concerns?**
   The tool is optimized for typical personal knowledge graphs. Very large graphs (10,000+ pages) may take longer to process but remain well within reasonable performance limits.

3. **How does the tool handle Logseq's special formatting?**
   The converter has specialized parsers for Logseq's bullet format, block references, page links, and properties, transforming each into the closest standard Markdown equivalent.

4. **What about assets like images and PDFs?**
   All assets are automatically copied to the output directory with updated references in the converted Markdown files.

5. **How are namespaces handled?**
   Namespaced pages (e.g., Projects/Website) are converted into a folder structure in the output, making navigation intuitive.

## Requirements

### User Stories

- As a Logseq user, I want to convert my knowledge graph to standard Markdown, so that I can publish it on platforms like GitHub Pages or Hugo.
- As a researcher, I want to maintain hierarchical organization when exporting notes, so that my document structure remains coherent.
- As a writer, I want my internal links and references preserved during conversion, so that navigation works in the exported version.
- As a content creator, I want images and other assets properly handled, so that my visual content appears correctly after conversion.
- As a team lead, I want to share my Logseq notes with non-Logseq users, so that team members can access the information in familiar formats.
- As a tech-savvy user, I want command-line options to customize the conversion process, so that I can adapt the output to my specific needs.

### Acceptance Criteria

1. GIVEN a Logseq graph directory, WHEN the conversion tool is run, THEN standard Markdown files are created in the specified output directory.
2. GIVEN a Logseq page with bullet points and nested content, WHEN converted, THEN the output preserves the hierarchical structure using standard Markdown formatting.
3. GIVEN a Logseq page with properties, WHEN converted, THEN the properties are transformed into YAML frontmatter.
4. GIVEN a Logseq page with internal links, WHEN converted, THEN the links are updated to work in the new structure.
5. GIVEN a Logseq page with images or other assets, WHEN converted, THEN the assets are copied to the output directory and references are updated.
6. GIVEN a Logseq page with namespaces, WHEN converted, THEN the namespace hierarchy is reflected in the output folder structure.
7. GIVEN a user running the tool with custom options, WHEN the conversion is complete, THEN the output respects those customizations.

### Out of Scope

- Converting standard Markdown back to Logseq format
- Preserving Logseq's graph visualization capabilities
- Real-time synchronization between Logseq and converted Markdown
- Web interface for the converter (command-line only for initial release)
- Integration with specific publishing platforms beyond creating standard Markdown

## Implementation Guidance

### High-Level Approach

The tool will use a modular architecture with separate components for reading Logseq files, parsing content, transforming to standard Markdown, and writing output files. This separation allows for clean, maintainable code and enables future extensions for additional features.

### Dependencies

- Node.js (v14 or higher)
- File system access to read Logseq graph and write output files
- Basic command-line interface libraries
- Parsing utilities for Markdown transformation

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|------------|
| Complex Logseq features can't be perfectly mapped to standard Markdown | Medium | High | Document limitations clearly and implement best-effort conversions with informative comments where appropriate |
| Large graphs could cause performance issues | Medium | Low | Implement streaming processing and progress indicators |
| Handling various Logseq versions and formats | High | Medium | Develop robust parsing with fallbacks for different notation styles |
| Asset path issues across different environments | Medium | Medium | Implement configurable path handling with absolute/relative path options |

### Success Metrics

- Successful conversion of test graphs with 95%+ content accuracy
- Preservation of all links, references, and navigation
- Performance benchmark: processing at least 100 pages per second on standard hardware
- Positive user feedback on utility and ease of use
