# Next Session Prompt

I'd like to continue working on the Logseq Utils project, specifically on the Logseq Smith tool we've recently published to npm.

Before we begin, please:

1. Review the Project Memory document at `.claude/PROJECT_MEMORY.md` for context
2. Check the Project Summary at `docs/PROJECT_SUMMARY.md` for current status
3. Look at the Promotion Ideas at `docs/PROMOTION_IDEAS.md`
4. Familiarize yourself with the repository structure
5. Read the PRD document at `docs/prd/PRD_001_LogseqMarkdownConverter.md` 

In this session, I'd like to focus on:

1. Creating a simple demo GIF for the README to show how the tool works
2. Enhancing the README with more examples and installation instructions
3. Implementing one or more of the promotion ideas to help spread the word
4. Discussing potential next features for the tool

Let's continue improving Logseq Smith and planning our next steps for the Logseq Utils collection of tools.

Feel free to suggest other priorities or improvements based on your review of the project files.
